## 📂 Contents  

### 🔍 Search Algorithms  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – explores the graph level by level  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – explores paths as deep as possible before backtracking  
- **BFS vs DFS Path Analysis** – compares both algorithms in terms of shortest path finding  
  - 📄 Implemented in: **bfs_dfs.ipynb**  

### 🎯 Heuristic Search  
- **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)** – selects nodes based only on heuristic values  
  - 📄 Implemented in: **greedy_best_first.ipynb**  
- **A\* Search** – combines path cost and heuristic for optimal search  
  - 📄 Implemented in: **a_star.ipynb**

## 📘 About  
This repository documents my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
Each notebook not only provides a working implementation but also discusses the **advantages, limitations, and comparisons** of the algorithms.
